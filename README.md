# CS0501: Data Structure - Homework
My solutions for the homework problems for this course in 24fall. My coding ability is poor and the implementation here is just as elegant as piles of s\*\*t, please forgive me, I believe you can create much better ones.

Note that homework varies depending on the class and time, so this is just for reference.
